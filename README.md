# Google Software Product Sprint

This repo contains my portfolio and [SPS](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/softwareproductsprint/) projects.

Google's Software Product Sprint brings together university students and Googlers for 11 weeks of 
virtual programming and community building. The programâ€™s mission is to build a network of support 
in order to increase representation in tech. Software Product Sprint students design and build web apps, 
gain applied Data Structures and Algorithm skills, and receive tailored career development resources.
